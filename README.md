**Project: Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Business Understanding:**

**Consider there is the wine manufacturing company that want to create a new brand of wine and they want to find the quality of each of the wines.**

**Wine Quality prediction benefits the industry by enhancing consumer confidence, facilitating market segmentation, guiding pricing strategies, promoting consistency, encouraging competition and innovation, educating consumers, aiding international trade, ensuring regulatory compliance, boosting wine tourism, attracting investment, and driving research and development.**

**We are going to build machine learning models that can take all chemical values such as fixed acidity,volatile acidity,citric acid,residual sugar,chlorides,free sulfur dioxide ,total sulfur dioxide etc to predict whether the quality of the wine is good or not.**

**Objective:To build a wine quality prediction system using some wine chemical parameters.**
